# jetty-angular2-spa
Single Page App using Jetty for API server and Angular 2 for the front end framework

## Prerequisites
Apache Maven: https://maven.apache.org/
npm: https://www.npmjs.com/

## To run BE server
`cd <project-root-directory>`

`mvn clean install`

`cd webapp-server`

`mvn exec:java`

## To run FE server
`cd webapp-client`

`npm install` (only needed for the first build to get all required packages)

`npm start`

## Important Concepts

Let us try to separate the concerns of Backend and Frontend. The Frontend should handle all issues related to showing client information and Backend should handle issues with application level logic. The Frontend is written in Angular2 and handles generating all of the HTML and routing on the client side. The Backend is a simple rest server which does not worry about generating dynamic pages or serving static content. It handles application level logic like what to do with the data from the Frontend.

## Frontend Server

We use Gulp to create a server to serve the Frontend files. There is only one root HTML file `index.html` in `webapp-client` (hence single page application). The rest of the "pages" are generated by Angular's routing capabilities. 

The gulp server has a proxy set up so that all requests that start with `/api` get routed to the Backend server. So for example, the default Frontend server runs at `http://localhost:9000` and the default Backend server runs at `http://localhost:8080`. So if we make a call to `http://localhost:9000/api/health/ping`, that call gets proxied to `http://localhost:8080/api/health/ping`.

## Backend Server

We use embedded Jetty 9 to run the Backend server. The Backend code also tries to separate out concerns by splitting relevant work into the various submodules of this project. While the modules are very small, they serve as an example of how to set up a multi module project using Maven, and can definitely grow larger based on code needs.
